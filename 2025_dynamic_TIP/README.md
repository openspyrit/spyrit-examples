# README
This folder contains code and instructions to reproduce the figures from 
> T. Maitre, E. Bretin, L. Mahieu-Williame, R. Phan, M. Sdika, N. Ducros, "Dual-arm motion-compensated single-pixel imaging".


## Getting started
- Install the packages from requirements.txt in a virtual environment.

- Install the SpyRiT package, e.g. with

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openspyrit/spyrit.git
```

- Checkout to the branch containing code for dynamic single-pixel imaging (will eventually be merged to master):

```shell
git checkout DynamicHadamSplit
```

- Set the working directory to be at the same level as spyrit and spyrit-examples





## Reproduce the figures
- Browse the different python notebooks fig_*.py to reproduce the results associated to each figure.
